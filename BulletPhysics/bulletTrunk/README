============================================
December 2023: This is an old, old, old attempt at building the Bullet physics engine that
happened to get checked into opensim-libs.
If you are interested in Bullet physics for OpenSimulator, check out the BulletSim
physics module in opensim-libs/trunk/unmanaged/BulletSim.
============================================

Bullet is a 3D Collision Detection and Rigid Body Dynamics Library for games and animation.
Free for commercial use, including Playstation 3, open source under the ZLib License.
Discrete and continuous collision detection, integrated into Blender 3D, and COLLADA 1.4 Physics import.
